//So I could not figure out how to add a ReadMe file to my project, so I decided to make one using
// a java file and just write out a readme comment style

//VIDEO DEMO!!!!!

// HOW TO RUN THIS APP

// 1. Go to the FlashcardApp class, and run it
// 2. You will then get a pop-up window with the app running, I suggest clicking the restore
//    button in the top right corner of the window and maximizing it
// 3. Here you can add Flashcards, simply type in the questions and answers that you want, after each
//    question and answer hit the next card button that will clear the question and answer fields
//    to which you can then continue to add more questions until you are done
// 4. Once you are done, click the file button in the top left of the app and then choose save
// 5. This will then prompt you to select a spot and name, save it live any file that you would normally
// 6. Then shut down the FlashcardApp, by closing the window

// FOR THE FLASHCARD PLAYER

// 7. Now go to the FlashCardPlayer class and run it
// 8. You will then get a pop-up window with the app running, I suggest clicking the restore and
//    maximizing it then screen
// 9. Then click the top left corner, where it says file, and then click "load card set"
// 10. You can then go into your computer's files and select the flashcard set you made earlier
// 11. Then click open which will then open the flashcard set you made earlier
// 12. Now all you have to do is quiz yourself by seeing the question, and then flipping the card
//     to see the real answer by selecting the show answer button
// 13. Once you see the answer by clicking the show answer button the button will become a "next card"
//     button and when that is clicked will bring you to the next card to repeat the process until
//     you are done

// FOR THE FLASHCARD QUIZ

// 14. If you want to try to quiz yourself in a more challenging way exit out of flashcard player and
//     run the FlashCardQuiz class
// 15. Once you run the FlashCardQuiz class you will get a pop-up window with the app running, and again
//     I suggest clicking the restore and maximizing it
// 16. Then click the top bottom of the screen where it says "Start Quiz" and then click it
// 17. You will then be prompted to find the flashcard set you made earlier, the same way you had
//     to find the file in your computer with FlashCardPlayer
// 18. Then click open which will then open the flashcard set you made earlier
// 19. Now that you have done that the question will pop up, and you type your answer down at the bottom
//     of the screen, and once you are done with the quiz it will tell you your score


// How to Read my comments

// I suggest starting in the Flashcard App, going to Flashcard class, then FlashcardPlayer class,
// then FlashCardQuiz class that's the way I wrote it so the comments will probably make more sense in
// that order
